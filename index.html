        <p class="subheader">“We push each other to be the best. It’s not
            uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs
            to be better, back to the drawing board’”
            - Lead vocalist of The Bees Knees</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">The Bees Knees</h2>
        <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
            from San Francisco, California. The band
            consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
            vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
            keyboardist and a drummer. The band
            achieved its first commercial success as an
            unsigned act, drawing attention from their
            future manager. Having extensive experience
            working with both new and seasoned acts, the
            manager was confident the band could
            succeed even further with more support,
            pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well
            known record label.<br/>
            From there, the band has soared, gaining
            international recognition and ranking in the
            top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
            immediately fell in love with the band’s original
            and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
            one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
            acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
            themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
            their candid and authentic performances on
            stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording
            their second studio album, looking to be
            released in early 2024.</p>
