                <p class="body-copy">
                        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                        from San Francisco, California. The band
                        consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                        vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
                        keyboardist and a drummer. The band
                        achieved its first commercial success as an
                        unsigned act, drawing attention from their
                        future manager. Having extensive experience
                        working with both new and seasoned acts, the
                        manager was confident the band could
                        succeed even further with more support,
                        pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well
                        known record label.
                </p>
                <p class="body-copy">
                        From there, the band has soared, gaining
                        international recognition and ranking in the
                        top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                        immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                        and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
                        one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
                        acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                        themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
                        their candid and authentic performances on
                        stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording
                        their second studio album, looking to be
                        released in early 2024.
